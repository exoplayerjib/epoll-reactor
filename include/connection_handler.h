 * @brief Non-blocking event handler for a single accepted TCP connection.
 *
 * @c ConnectionHandler implements the @c IEventHandler interface and is driven
 * by the @c Reactor event loop via epoll.
 *
 * On a read event, it reads available data from the socket into a fixed-size buffer
 * and returns a continuation task containing the data for processing on a worker thread.
 *
 * Outbound messages are enqueued via the write queue and drained lazily by
 * @c handle_write() when epoll signals @c EPOLLOUT. After the queue is
 * empty the handler downgrades the epoll interest back to @c EPOLLIN only.
 *
 * The class is non-copyable and non-movable; ownership is managed through
 * @c std::shared_ptr inside the @c Reactor.
